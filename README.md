# Watchcmd (cli tool)

The simplest way to watch a command output.

## Install globally

```
$ npm i -g watchcmd
```

## Run it with any command

You can run command, string of commands, it will repeatedly report the result on the shell screen. e.g:

```
# Run istats every 2 seconds
watchcmd -t 2000 "istats"

# Append date after command output
watchcmd "istats; echo; date"
```

## Why watchcmd

### Watchcmd vs watch

![Watchcmd vs Watch](./assets/watchcmd-vs-watch.png)

Watchcmd's command can be further simplified as `watchcmd istats`, if you want it to be updated once per second.

NOTE: In some system, you can pass `--color` to watch to resolve this color commands issue.

### Watchcmd vs `while sleep...`

While

```
while sleep 1; do clear; istats; done
```

is a workable solution, but flicking. The ultimate `while` solution would be (it's fine to use it):

```
while sleep 1; do istats > /tmp/istats_file; date >> /tmp/istats_file; clear; cat /tmp/istats_file; done
```

But hey, isn't it complicated?

Watchcmd isn't that complicated, it's just a single JavaScript file that does all the hard work for you.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add an argument to monitor content on screen and send notifications to user.
- [ ] Skip execution while the command is executing.
